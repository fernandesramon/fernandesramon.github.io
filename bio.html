                Ramon Fernandes is a senior at Tufts University where he is majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Theater.
                He is currently a board member and treasurer of Tufts' umbrella group for performing arts and is on the production
                team of many shows at Tufts as well as a few outside organizations. He strongly believes in the power of the performing arts
                and hopes to one day be able to combine his interests in CS and the arts.
                He's had to write a number of bios and hopes that he is closer to mastering the art.
